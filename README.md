## Project One: Run-time and Memory Analysis

- **Problem Solved**: The problem in Project One involved managing and analyzing data using efficient data structures. The goal was to implement and compare various algorithms in terms of their run-time and memory efficiency.
  
- **Approach**: I selected appropriate data structures, such as hash tables, to manage data efficiently. Understanding the time complexity of different algorithms and their impact on memory usage helped me make informed decisions throughout the project.
  
- **Challenges Overcome**: One of the major challenges I encountered was optimizing the sorting algorithms to handle large datasets effectively. To overcome this, I revisited the course materials, practiced with smaller examples, and broke down the problem into smaller steps.

- **Expansion of Approach**: This project expanded my approach to designing software by emphasizing the importance of selecting the right data structure for the right task. It made me more conscious of performance trade-offs in software development.

- **Evolution of Programming Style**: My programming style has evolved to prioritize maintainability, readability, and adaptability. I now focus on writing clean, modular code with clear comments, consistent variable naming, and attention to detail, ensuring that future modifications and debugging will be easier.

## Project Two: Course Planner

- **Problem Solved**: The problem in Project Two was to create a course planner application that allows users to load course data, display an alphanumeric list of courses, and view course prerequisites.

- **Approach**: I used a hash table data structure to store the course information. This allowed for efficient lookup and manipulation of course data, which was essential for providing quick responses to user queries.

- **Challenges Overcome**: A key challenge was ensuring that the program could handle invalid inputs gracefully, such as incorrect file names or non-existent course numbers. I implemented error-checking mechanisms to improve the program's robustness.

- **Expansion of Approach**: This project helped me deepen my understanding of how to organize and manipulate data in a real-world application. It also reinforced the importance of user experience in software design by ensuring that the program responds well to various user inputs.

- **Evolution of Programming Style**: My focus on writing maintainable and adaptable code has continued to grow. This project reinforced the value of modular design, where each function and data structure has a single, clear responsibility.

## Reflection

Through these projects, I have expanded my knowledge of data structures, algorithms, and software design. I’ve learned to select appropriate data structures based on their performance characteristics and how to implement them in a way that balances run-time efficiency with memory usage.

By working on these projects, I’ve become more comfortable with designing programs that are both robust and user-friendly. My programming style has evolved to prioritize clean, readable code, with a focus on maintainability and adaptability.

These projects have prepared me to tackle more complex challenges in software development, as I now have a stronger foundation in data structures, algorithm design, and the importance of considering performance in my solutions.
